# Profile -  A Personal Profile Website for Chris Wein

## Description of the site
This website is a personal website designed to show off my work over the coming months and years.

## Sections of the Website
* "About Me" section that gives a brief description of who I am.

## Website Features

* Tablet and mobile readiness.
* Links to outside websites.
